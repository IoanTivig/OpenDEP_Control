# OpenDEP Control
DEP experiments automation and control software. With this software you can control all 3 machines which are
used in DEP experiments: function generator, microscope camera and microfluidic pump. The range of control is limited
on the DEP application. 

At this moment we try to make the software function with any webcam or DSRL camera (though the webcam option is 
recomended), Agilent Function generators (thorugh the seral port,) and Fluidgent microfluidic pump. In the future,
compatibility with other devices will be added.

It is a part of OpenDEP project, and one of the three programs delivered by the OpenDEP team: 
1. OpenDEP Compute (for spectra fitting and data conversion)
2. OpenDEP Control (for experiments automation and control of machines)
3. OpenDEP View (for visualization of spectra and spectra generation based on parameters).
